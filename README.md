# My Portfolio 

This repository works as my portfolio. Development is done in Javascript and the VueJS framework. The webapp covers the home view with a short description and the project view with three of my personal projects. The dist folder is purely holding the files to deploy the application. Every build of the project will create a new dist folder.

## Project setup

The application can easily be installed, deployed locally and deployed to a Github Page using subtrees.

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Setup Github Pages

Use this command after changes are pushed to the repository and you want to deploy these to Github Pages:
```
npm run deploy
```
